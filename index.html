                <p>"InkDiscover helped me find the perfect Japanese artist for my sleeve. The site helped me sift through many artists until
                    I found the perfect one. The site showed me where the studio was so I could make sure I knew how to get there and 
                    contacting the artists was so easy from there."

        <h1>The Art of Tattooing</h1>

        <p>Tattooing is an artform that has exsisted since the Neolithic age, the last period of the Stone Age. One of the most prevalent and oldest examples of is
            tattoos found on Otzi the Iceman who had about 61 tattoos on his body when scientists found him in 1991. Initally, scientists thought that the tattoos served
            a medical purpose as they notice that the clusters tend to be around the lower back and joints where he was suffering degeneration. However with the most recent 
            tattoo inventory, they also discovered tattoos on his chest where there was no signs of aliment.
